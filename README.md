CPLEX.jl
========

The CPLEX.jl package provides an unofficial interface for using [IBM's CPLEX Optimizer™](http://www.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/) from the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/). You cannot use CPLEX.jl without having purchased and installed a copy of CPLEX Optimizer™ from [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/). This package is available free of charge and in no way replaces or alters any functionality of IBM's CPLEX Optimizer product.

CPLEX.jl is a Julia interface for the CPLEX optimization software. CPLEX functionality is extensive, so coverage is incomplete, but the basic functionality for solving linear and mixed-integer programs is provided.

CPLEX.jl is intended for use with the [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) solver interface; an internal API, while present, is not documented.

Setting up CPLEX on OS X and Linux
----------------------------------

NOTE: CPLEX [does not officially support linking to their dynamic C library](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=ca96447c-fe2d-4e8a-900e-cfe358a9bcec&ps=25), which is necessary for use from Julia. However, the steps outlined below have worked for OS-X, Windows, and Linux machines.

1. First, you must obtain a copy of the CPLEX software and a license; trial versions and academic licenses are available [here](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/products/optimization/cplex-studio-preview-edition/).

2. Once CPLEX is installed on your machine, point the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable to the directory containing the CPLEX library by adding, for example, ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to your start-up file (e.g. ``.bash_profile``, [adding library path on Ubuntu](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13428910/how-to-set-the-environmental-variable-ld-library-path-in-linux for a)). On linux, make sure this directory contains ``libcplexXXX.so`` where ``XXX`` is stands for the version number; on OS-X the file should be named ``libcplexXXX.dylib``. Alternatively, you can also use the `CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES` environment variable as follows:
  ```
  $ CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES=/path/to/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux julia -e 'Pkg.add("CPLEX"); Pkg.build("CPLEX")'
  ```

3. At the Julia prompt, run
  ```
  julia> Pkg.add("CPLEX")
  ```
(or manually clone this module to your ``.julia`` directory).

4. Check that your version is included in ``deps/build.jl`` in the aliases for the library dependency; if not, open an issue.

Note for windows
----------------

Currently, CPLEX.jl is compatible only with 64-bit CPLEX and 64-bit Julia on Windows. CPLEX.jl attempts to automatically find the CPLEX library based on the ``CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES`` environmental variable set by the CPLEX installer.

Help! I got `LoadError: Unable to locate CPLEX installation`
----------------------------------

Which version of CPLEX are you trying to install? Currently CPLEX.jl only supports 1260, 1261, 1262, 1263, 1270, and 1271. If it's not one of those, [file an issue](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/CPLEX.jl/issues/new) with the version number you'd like to support. Some steps need to be taken (like checking for new or renamed parameters) before CPLEX.jl can support new versions.

#### If you're on OS X or Linux

The most common problem is not setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` correctly. Open a terminal and check the output of
```
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
is the path to the CPLEX installation. If it's not, did you follow step 2 above?

#### If you're on Linux or Windows

The most common problem is not setting `CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES` correctly. Open a Julia prompt and check that the output of
```julia
julia> ENV["CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES"]
```
is the path to the CPLEX installation. If you get a `key "CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES" not found` error, make sure the environment variable is set correctly, or just set it from within the Julia prompt
```julia
julia> ENV["CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES"] = "path/to/cplex/installation
julia> Pkg.build("CPLEX")
```

Parameters
----------

Solver parameters can be passed through the ``CplexSolver()`` object, e.g., ``CplexSolver(CPX_PARAM_EPINT=1e-8)``. Parameters match those of the CPLEX documentation. Additionally, the ``mipstart_effortlevel`` parameter can be used to tell CPLEX how much effort to put into turning warmstarts into feasible solutions, with possible values ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_AUTO``, ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_CHECKFEAS``, ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_SOLVEFIXED``, ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_SOLVEMIP``, ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_REPAIR``, and ``CPLEX.CPX_MIPSTART_NOCHECK``.
