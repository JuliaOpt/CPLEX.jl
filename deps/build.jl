"""
    is_general_registry()

Detect if we are being called from AutoMerge CI on the Julia General registry.

The Julia General registry attempts to install and test packages. Since it does't have a
CPLEX license, this build will fail, preventing auto-merge. Therefore, we need to detect
when we are being called and silently bail.

Complicating matters is the very particular way in which we get called, because we don't get
a typical installation. In particular, a very restricted set of environment variables is
passed. See here for details:
https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/RegistryCI.jl/blob/0d19525c7120176e5e0f11637dcca7b229b5f0c9/src/AutoMerge/guidelines.jl#L178-L196

This check is fragile, and subject to breakage. But it seems highly unlikely that a user
will have a set-up identical to this.
